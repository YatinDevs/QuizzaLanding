    👉  The Navigation Bar should have the Logo of Ixigo website on the Top Left. Clicking here should redirect the user to the homepage of the Ixigo website.

    👉  Add different options to the navbar, like Flights, Trains, Bus and Hotels. Each button represents a different service offered by Ixigo.
